* find-critical-mass
This is the inlists and machinery used to find the critical ignition
mass as discussed in Appendix C.  (It's basically my MESA work
directory, but without the boilerplate files.)

Run ~make_inlists.rb~, which generates the inlists using Bill Wolf's
[[https://github.com/wmwolf/MesaScript][MesaScript]].  Then ~make_models.sh~ generates initial models of varying
masses and ~evolve_models.sh~ evolves them to ignition (or
non-ignition).  There is some logic to determine what happens in
~src/run_star_extras.f~.
