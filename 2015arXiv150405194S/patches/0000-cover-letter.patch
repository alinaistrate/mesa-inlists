Subject: [PATCH 00/12] Modify calculation of A=24 & A=20 weak reactions

This code improves the MESA weak rates in dense plasmas where the
Fermi energy is comparable to the enery gap of the transitions.  It
calculates the rates on-the-fly in a way that avoids issues associated
with interpolation in sparse tables.  See Schwab, Quataert, and
Bildsten (2015) for a a detailed explanation of the implementation and
Paxton et al. (2015) for verification tests.

To directly reproduce Schwab et al. (2015), follow these instructions.

Howevever, unless you really need to use this exact version, you're
probably better off using r7624 or later, where these changes are have
been integrated into mainline MESA.

Download a fresh copy of mesa r6596.  Probably best to go grab the zip
files from here:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mesa/files/releases/

Unzip it, and rename to mesa-weak to avoid confusion.

Save the patch directory.  It contains all the patches necessary to
use the on-the-fly weak rates.  Then, while in the mesa-weak
directory, run the command

    for p in patches/*.patch; do patch -p1 < $p; done

which applies all the patches.  The output should look like:

`----

Now, install MESA as usual

    ./install

and everything should go smoothly.

To use the new weak rates, add the following controls to your star_job
inlist

    use_special_weak_rates = .true.
    ion_coulomb_corrections = 'PCR2009'
    electron_coulomb_corrections = 'Itoh2002'

With those settings, you should see electron captures happen on Mg-24
around logRho = 9.6 and on Ne-20 around logRho = 9.95.
